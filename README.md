# Project Overview
The goal of this project is to set up a database, clean and transform raw data, and perform exploratory data analysis and sales forecasting. The workflow is as follows:
Create and initialize the database.
Clean and transform raw data.
Perform EDA and forecast future sales.

# File Descriptions
# Database Creation
DATABASE.sql: This script contains SQL commands to create the necessary database tables and constraints.

# Data Cleaning and Transformation
DATA CLEANING STEP1.sql: This script is the first step in the data cleaning process.
DATA CLEANING STEP 2-7.sql: This script contains subsequent steps (2 to 7) for cleaning and transforming the data.
view.sql: This script creates views for easier data access and analysis.

# Exploratory Data Analysis and Sales Forecasting
EDA&SALES FORECAST.ipynb: This Jupyter Notebook contains Python code for performing EDA and sales forecasting using the cleaned data.

# Database Creation
To initialize the database, execute the DATABASE.sql script. This script will create the necessary tables and define the constraints required for the project.

-- Execute the following command in your SQL environment
source DATABASE.sql;

# Data Cleaning and Transformation
Data cleaning and transformation are divided into multiple steps:
Execute DATA CLEANING STEP1.sql to perform the initial data cleaning.
Execute DATA CLEANING STEP 2-7.sql to continue with the cleaning and transformation processes.
Execute view.sql to create views that will be used in the EDA and forecasting stage.

-- Execute the following commands in your SQL environment
source DATA CLEANING STEP1.sql;
source DATA CLEANING STEP 2-7.sql;
source view.sql;
Exploratory Data Analysis and Sales Forecasting
The EDA&SALES FORECAST.ipynb Jupyter Notebook contains all the necessary code for conducting EDA and forecasting future sales. It includes data visualization, statistical analysis, and predictive modeling.

To run the notebook, you need to have Jupyter installed along with the required Python libraries. You can install the dependencies using the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Then, launch the Jupyter Notebook:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook EDA&SALES FORECAST.ipynb
Setup Instructions
Clone the repository to your local machine:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/data-pipeline-sales-forecast.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd data-pipeline-sales-forecast
Set up the database by executing the SQL scripts as described in the previous sections.
Install the required Python packages:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Launch the Jupyter Notebook for EDA and sales forecasting:
bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook EDA&SALES FORECAST.ipynb
Usage
Follow the instructions provided in each section to execute the SQL scripts and Jupyter Notebook. Ensure that your database is correctly set up and that all dependencies are installed.
